farsR makes working with data downloaded from the US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's [Fatality Analysis Reporting System](https://www.nhtsa.gov/research-data/fatality-analysis-reporting-system-fars) easy. It provides two simple functions to *process* and *plot*  the data:

* `fars_summarize_years()`

* `fars_map_state()`

This document introduces you to farsR's two main functions, and shows you how to apply them to the respective data.

*Important*: Both functions of the farsR package assume that the respective FARS data was downloaded before and that it resides in the current working directory in the following format: accident_[year].csv.bz2.

## The data

The farsR package comes with 3 files of FARS data from 2013 to 2015. We will demonstrate working with farsR's functions using data from 2013 and from 2014.

We will copy the respective files to your current working directory.


```{r}

file.copy(system.file("extdata", "accident_2013.csv.bz2", package = "farsR"),getwd())

file.copy(system.file("extdata", "accident_2014.csv.bz2", package = "farsR"),getwd())

```


## Summarizing data 

Next, we will summarize the accidents included in the 2013 FARS report file by month and year in a tibble using `fars_summarize_years()`.

```{r}
library(farsR)

fars2013 <- fars_summarize_years(2013)
fars2013
```

Since `fars_summarize_years()` is vectorized you can also create a summary report for multiple years.

```{r}

fars_many_years <- fars_summarize_years(c(2013, 2014))
fars_many_years

```

```{r}

```

## Plotting data

You plot FARS data using `fars_map_state`. The function will plot all accident locations for a given year and federal state on a US federal state map.

```{r}

fars_map_state(13, 2014)
```
